| **Status** | `completed` |
| **Topic** | From Prompts to Harness Engineering to Loop Engineering — The Workflow Shift in AI-Native Development |
| **Started** | 2026-06-22 |
| **Current Step** | STEP 6c COMPLETE (2026-06-24) — Slide deck built by `deck-builder` from the finalized blog + LinkedIn post. **12-slide** Marp deck at `content/deck/loop-engineering-ai-native-development-deck.md`, exported to **PDF** (`...-deck.pdf`) and **PPTX** (`...-deck.pptx`). Arc: hook → reframe → four-era staircase → eras 1–3 ceilings → what a loop is → harness vs. loop (nouns vs. verbs) → four postures → why now / validation bottleneck (Stripe 1,300+ PRs/week; SWE-bench 12.47%→76.8%; $0.05–$0.96/task) → proof at scale → first loop this week → CTA (canonical URL). All 9 visuals embedded (p1-05→s2, p1-01→s4, p1-02→s5, p2-01→s6, p1-03→s7, p2-02→s8, p2-03→s9, p2-04→s10, p2-05→s11). Per-slide humor + intellectual speaker notes (topic-tagged, single-line prose) verified in `ppt/notesSlides/`; triple-render + 12-page rasterized visual QA passed. First-person voice, no "leverage". **All user-selected outputs complete (LinkedIn + Reel/Short + Slide deck) — pipeline Status set to `completed`.** |
| **Series** | `no (single comprehensive post)` |
| **Current Part** | n/a — single post `content/from-prompts-to-loop-engineering.md` |

### Step Checklist

- [x] Step 0: Reference analysis
- [ ] Step 1b: Content research (STORM) — `content-researcher`
- [x] Steps 1-2: Strategy + outline
- [x] Step 2b: Scope assessment (single vs. series) — 13/16 → ran series test → **per-part word floor FAILED** (drafted Part 1 ~1,600w < 2,400w) → **single comprehensive post**. Skill fixed to enforce the 2,400-word floor.
- [x] Step 2c: Multi-dimensional analysis — 3 personas, 8 practices, WAF: OpsExcellence+Cost primary
- [x] Step 2d: Visual opportunity mapping — 10 blog companions (5/part); heroes = staircase + loop diagram; `content/visual-opportunity-map.md` + `content/visual-style-map.md`
- [ ] Step 2e: Infographic art direction
- [x] Step 3: Blog post draft — merged single post written and cascade-validated (`content/from-prompts-to-loop-engineering.md`, ~2,800 words, all 10 sections). Supersedes the deleted ~1,600-word Part 1 draft. Full four-tier cascade re-run against the merged post (2026-06-23):
  - Tier 0 preflight → `content/preflight-report.md` — GATE: PASS (0 Error / 0 Warning, exit 0)
  - Tier 1 critic + fact-check → `content/tier1-critic-review.md` — GATE: FAIL → escalate (2 high-risk-class claim-citation Warnings; 15/15 load-bearing claims grounded, 0 Errors)
  - Tier 2 diverse jury → `content/tier2-jury-verdict.md` — 3 disjoint jurors, 2–1 approve-with-residual on each item → Tier 3
  - Tier 3 escalation gate → `content/escalation-digest.md` — 2 rows, both defensible as written; residual = publish-time source re-pull only (no draft-time change)
  - Phase D metrics → `content/critique-metrics.md` + `content/cascade-metrics-report.md` — 2 runs; escalation rate 100%, escalation precision 50%, GATE: PASS (exit 0)
  - Residual human action before publish: re-pull the SWE-bench figures (12.47%→76.8%, $0.05–$0.96) and the OpenAI harness-engineering page (currently 403). Böckeler "guides and sensors" already paraphrased — no edit needed.
- [x] Step 3b: Visual assets — 9 companions rendered at 320 DPI by `content/visuals/render_loop_engineering.py` and embedded into the post (markers replaced; Tier 0 preflight GATE PASS, all paths resolve). Re-rendered 2026-06-23 after migrating the p1-01 staircase HERO from hand-placed matplotlib to D2 (auto-layout, `direction: up`) to end the hand-geometry defect class; deep QA via image view confirms clean cards/arrows/title/sources, no overlap / overflow / occlusion. Style diversity across the set:
  - `p1-05-pull-quote.png` (typographic) — the reframe pull-quote [line 9]
  - `p1-01-staircase.png` (diagram-as-code ★HERO, d2 vertical climb) — four-era staircase [line 17]
  - `p1-02-ceilings.png` (hand-drawn) — three ceiling cards [line 36]
  - `p2-01-loop.png` (diagram-as-code ★HERO, d2 vertical) — plan→act→observe→verify→correct [line 50]
  - `p1-03-harness-vs-loop.png` (editorial-illustration) — nouns vs. verbs [line 60]
  - `p2-02-postures.png` (hand-drawn) — outside/in/on the loop + flywheel [line 77]
  - `p2-03-bottleneck.png` (data-exhibit, directional) — generation vs. validation [line 87]
  - `p2-04-stripe-swebench.png` (data-exhibit) — Stripe before/after + SWE-bench trajectory + cost band [line 95]
  - `p2-05-first-loop-checklist.png` (hand-drawn) — your first loop checklist [line 116]
- [ ] Step 3b-img: hero/illustrative imagery (optional)
- [x] Step 3c: Quality review — `quality-reviewer` verdict PASS; 1 surgical fix (p1-02-ceilings.png repositioned to end of Eras 1–3 with setup sentence); no "leverage"; data preserved; Tier 0 preflight GATE PASS. Re-validated 2026-06-23 after migrating the p1-01 staircase HERO to D2 (re-rendered + deep-QA via image view, preflight GATE PASS).
- [x] Step 3d: SEO optimization — in-place on `content/from-prompts-to-loop-engineering.md` (2026-06-23). Primary keyword "loop engineering" + 5 secondary; added `seo:` frontmatter (title 50 chars / meta 151 chars / slug `loop-engineering-ai-native-development`); front-loaded primary keyword in subtitle; optimized 5 H2s with secondary keywords (reader-first); verified descriptive alt text on all 9 images (paths unchanged). Tier 0 preflight deterministically validated GATE: PASS (0/0/0).
- [x] Step 4a: Social distribution strategy — `content/social-strategy.md` (2026-06-24). 4 angles mapped to selected platforms (LinkedIn + Reel/Short + deck); 7-day LinkedIn-led sequence; 9 visuals mapped to posts; canonical URL in first-comment CTAs; first-person voice, no "leverage".
- [ ] Step 4a-visual: Visual-first asset pack
- [x] Step 4: LinkedIn post — `content/linkedin-post-loop-engineering.md` (2026-06-24). 3 posts (Day 0 lead / Day 4 / Day 7) per `content/social-strategy.md` sequence; plain-text + Unicode versions each; visuals mapped per post; canonical URL in first comment only; first-person voice, no "leverage".
- [x] Step 4c: Social platform selection — LinkedIn + Reel/Short video + Slide deck (PPTX + PDF)
- [ ] Step 5: X/Twitter thread — skipped by user selection
- [x] Step 6b: Reel/Short video — `content/reel-script-loop-engineering.md` (2026-06-24). 75s vertical script per `content/social-strategy.md` Step 6b: hook → staircase → validation-bottleneck pivot → first-loop CTA; visual beats `p1-05-pull-quote.png` → `p1-01-staircase.png` → `p2-04-stripe-swebench.png` → `p2-01-loop.png` → `p2-05-first-loop-checklist.png`; canonical URL in caption + end-card; first-person voice, no "leverage".
- [x] Step 6c: Slide deck (PPTX + PDF, humor + intellectual speaker notes) — `deck-builder`. 12-slide Marp deck `content/deck/loop-engineering-ai-native-development-deck.md` → `.pdf` + `.pptx` (2026-06-24). Blog-arc spine, all 9 visuals embedded on matching slides, per-slide topic-tagged humor + intellectual notes verified in `ppt/notesSlides/`; triple-render (HTML/PDF/PPTX) + 12-page rasterized visual QA passed; slide-count pill matches 12 slides. First-person voice, no "leverage".
- [ ] Step 7: Brand audit
- [ ] Step 7b: Grounded content review
- [ ] Step 8: YouTube script — skipped by user selection
- [x] Step 10: Web publishing — `content/from-prompts-to-loop-engineering.md` → `docs/blog/loop-engineering-ai-native-development.html` (2026-06-23). 9 visuals copied to `docs/blog/visuals/` and referenced via relative `visuals/` paths; linked from `docs/index.html`; canonical URL logged to `content/publishing-log.md`.
- [ ] Step 11: Social publishing
- [ ] Step 12: Platform distillation draft

**Series values:** `not-applicable` | `pending-assessment` | `yes (N parts)` | `no`

**Status values:** `not-started` | `in-progress` | `completed` | `blocked`

> **What to do:**
> - If Status is `not-started` → You're clear to start a new run. Edit references/preferences below, then run `@content-pipeline` or `/new-content-pipeline`
> - If Status is `in-progress` → Content creation is underway. Run `@content-pipeline` to resume from where it left off
> - If Status is `completed` → All steps done! Review the content, then run `/archive-content` to archive and start fresh
> - If Status is `blocked` → See Current Step for what needs attention
>
> **Rollback / redo rule:** If any agent goes back to rebuild an earlier phase, update this status before editing: set Status to `in-progress`, set Current Step to the earliest step being redone with the date and reason, uncheck that step and all downstream dependent steps, and mark published/social outputs stale until republished. Do not leave this file saying a later step is complete while earlier content is being regenerated.

## Model Selection

Choose which model to use for content generation. Select your model in the **VS Code Copilot model picker** before running agents.

### Model Family Detection

The pipeline uses the selected model for content generation and GitHub Copilot's **rubber-duck review** feature for adversarial review gates. No model-family switch is required before reviews.

| Family | Model name prefix |
|--------|------------------|
| `anthropic` | Claude * |
| `openai` | GPT-*, o* |
| `google` | Gemini * |

### Rubber-Duck Review

| Role | Selection Rule |
|------|---------------|
| **Content Creation** | User selects any model; pipeline records the family used |
| **Critic Review** | Use GitHub Copilot **rubber-duck review**; no model switch required |
| **Visual Generation** | User selects any model |

> **How it works**: After content is created, the orchestrator runs rubber-duck review as the adversarial critique gate, then routes findings to the appropriate reviewer/fixer agents.

### Current Run

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Creation model family** | `anthropic` |
| **Review method** | `GitHub Copilot rubber-duck` |

### Current Selection

**Preferred model**: _(select any model in the VS Code Copilot picker — agents inherit your selection automatically)_

Review gates use GitHub Copilot rubber-duck review. No specific model versions are required — use whatever is available.

## Output Preferences

### Blog
- **Target length**: ~3,000 words per part (if series)
- **Output path**: `content/`

### Image Generation (hybrid AI imagery)

> Controls the optional image step (Step 3b-img). Scope is **hero / backdrop / scene /
> conceptual-illustration** assets only — diagrams, infographics, flows, comparison
> matrices, and executive exhibits stay deterministic/programmatic.
>
> **Two modes, default is free + offline:**
> - `programmatic` — deterministic hero/backdrop rendered by `scripts.visuals.generated.programmatic`
>   (HTML/CSS+Chromium, brand tokens, reserved negative space). **No API key, no network, no
>   cost, fully reproducible.** This is the default.
> - `ai` — calls an external image model (OpenAI/Azure) for a photoreal/illustrative look.
>   Opt-in only; needs a key + network + spend. See `agents-and-skills/image-provider-comparison.md`.
> - `off` — skip image generation entirely.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **mode** | `programmatic` |
| **provider** (ai mode only) | `openai` |
| **model** (ai mode only) | `gpt-image-1` |
| **size** | `1024x1024` |
| **quality** (ai mode only) | `medium` |
| **max_images_per_run** | `3` |
| **reference_images** | _(paths/URLs for grounding, optional)_ |

> Every generated image (either mode) is written to `content/visuals/generated/` with a sidecar
> JSON (mode, license, safety, and for `ai` the provider/model/prompt/seed), must pass the
> deterministic `scripts.visuals.generated.inspect_image` pre-screen (no-text, brand-color
> fidelity, negative-space), and then `visual-reviewer`.

### Series Configuration

> Auto-populated by scope assessment. Edit manually to override.

| **Total Parts** | 1 |
| **Current Part** | n/a — single post `content/from-prompts-to-loop-engineering.md` |
| **Single-post focus** | The full four-era staircase (word → context → rig → loop) + the loop-engineering payoff in one ~2,800-word post; IC practitioner through tech lead |
| **Publishing Cadence** | n/a — single post |

### Dimension Analysis

> Auto-populated by multi-dimensional analysis (Step 2c). Edit manually to override.

### Social Platform Selection

> The pipeline always generates LinkedIn. For other platforms, select which to include:

- [x] LinkedIn (always included)
- [ ] X/Twitter thread
- [ ] Reddit post
- [x] Reel/Short video (60-90 sec)
- [ ] YouTube long-form script (8-12 min)
- [ ] Slide deck (PPTX + PDF, humor + intellectual speaker notes) — optional, after blog + LinkedIn finalized

> **Note:** Pipeline will ask for confirmation at Step 4c. Pre-check platforms above to skip the prompt.

### Long-Form Platform Distribution (Step 12)

> Generates platform-optimized excerpts for Medium, Substack, and LinkedIn Article. Visual-first when a `content/visuals/distilled/{slug}-{mode}/manifest.md` exists; text-only fallback otherwise.

- [x] Medium (700–900 words, Import tool auto-sets canonical URL — SEO safe)
- [x] Substack (300–500 words excerpt only — post as Substack Note, not newsletter)
- [x] LinkedIn Article (700–900 words, unique angle — NOT a republish of the blog)
